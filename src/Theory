1. public - Public is accessible through out the project
      2. private - private is accessible only within class
      3. protected - protected is accessible only within a package,
                     but accessible in another package through inheritance
      4. default - it is accessible only within a package. and it is more restrictive than protected.


Polymorphism -
            It is ability to take many forms.
            ex-
            1 . Method overloading - if same method name have multiple time is same class it is called method overloading.
                                     It increases program readability.
            rule for method overloading - 1. same name but different number of parameters
                                          2. same number of parameter but different datatype.

            2. Method Overriding - If child class have same method name in that parent class then is called method overriding.
